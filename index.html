		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, advised by <a href="https://www.weitaoxu.com">Dr. Weitao Xu</a>. My research interests include Wireless Sensing, LoRa Network, Energy Harvesting, and Cybersecurity. I received my M.E. degree at Australia National University (ANU), co-advised by <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~gferraro/index.html">Dr. Gabriela Ferraro</a> and <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u5170295/">Dr. Qing Wang</a>. I obtained my B.E. degree at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE) at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by <a href="http://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/Personal/xwang8/index.html">Prof. Xinbing Wang</a>. Meanwhile, I was admitted in 2014 <a href="https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en">ZHIYUAN Honors Program</a> - Engineering (Top 10%).</p>
